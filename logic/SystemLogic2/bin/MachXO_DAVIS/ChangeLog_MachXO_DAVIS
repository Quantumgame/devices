Revision 9912 - 05.10.2017
- APS/DVS: changed orientation to upper left corner (computer
  graphics format), was lower left corner before (OpenGL format).
- APS: separated state machine for external ADC from internal
  ADC one, now called 'APSADCStateMachineExternal'.
- APS: added ROI0Enabled configuration parameter, now only sends
  ROI information if ROI region 0 is enabled.
- APS: doubled maximum values of ResetTime and RowSettleTime.
- APS: in global shutter mode, don't do RESET_A on each column
  reset read, just do it once at the end of all reset reads.
  This improves image quality without any dark shadows side-effect.
- Multiplexer: more robust timestamp handling regarding wrap/reset.
- FX2: the EarlyPacketDelay is now specified in cycles @ LogicClock.
- LED: changed mapping of camera LEDs:
    - LED0 -> on if camera is master
    - LED1 -> on if not transmitting data (ready to transmit)
    - LED2 -> on if camera is being configured
- SPIConfig: reduced register usage.
- FIFO: properly use read-side reset to reset read-side registers.
- Counters: simplified counter design.
- BufferClear: simpler, more robust design.
- ClockDomainGenerator: synchronize lock-reset.
- EdgeDetector: reduced register usage.

Revision 9880 - 21.05.2017
- Added EXTERNAL_ADC_BUS_WIDTH to Settings.
- Updated to Lattice Diamond 3.9.
- Removed SyncOutSwitch_AI/SyncInSwitch_AI (unused).
- Use ClockDomainGenerator to generate clocks.
- IMU: timestamp all special events, not only START.
- APS: add set Exposure information.
- APS: fully separate external and internal ADC code.
- APS: added ADCTestMode_S (disabled for DAVIS240).
- APS: resized counters to be smaller (conserve resources).
- DVS: AER ACK counters resized to 4 bits (conserve resources).
- FX2: Early Packet counter is now in cycles, not 125Âµs
  slices. This avoids a multiplier (conserve resources).

Revision 7449 - 14.10.2015
- APSADC: improve behavior of Rolling Shutter frame capture,
  by keeping TXGate open, no event bursts in the event output
  are generated anymore.
- APSADC: send information on ROI parameters for correct
  ROI setup on host. Implemented for Quad-ROI too.
- Updated event definitions for new ROI events.
- Updated default parameters to be aligned with latest
  host-side libcaer settings, and not dropping events
  (especially APS or IMU which are multi-part).

Revision 7017 - 12.08.2015
- Change constraints file to improve timing.
- DVSAER: fix bug in new RowOnlyFilter introduced in
  revision 6791. On columns with multiple DVS events
  being read out, the column events would be sent
  twice, resulting in a second event with same
  address and timestamp.

Revision 6906 - 29.06.2015
- Use VHDL range attribute in all files.
- ExtInput: specify length values in cycles directly
  instead of 100ns slices. This is more precise and
  avoids costly multipliers.
- APSADC: use ADC clock frequency value to derive
  configuration parameter widths and values.

Revision 6791 - 29.05.2015
- DVSAER: rewrote RowOnly filter and moved it to be
  executed as last stage after the main state machine.
  This has no functional implications for FX2 devices
  currently sold.

Revision 6735 - 21.05.2015
- APSADC: several changes to accomodate fast pipelined
  readout on new FX3 devices. No functional changes for
  FX2 devices currently sold.

Revision 6616 - 08.05.2015
- DVSAER: add ExternalAERControl configuration parameter
  to have external AER masters control the AER bus, for
  example other boards via the CAVIAR connector.
- ExtInput: add HasGenerator configuration parameter
  to check for generator presence.
- SPIConfig: fixed bug that would leave the SPI state
  machine stuck in the stInput state and wrongly then
  drive a logic low value onto the bus full-time,
  disrupting communication for other SPI slave devices.
  (Only ECP3_FX3 boards are visibly affected by this.)

Revision 6565 - 04.05.2015
- Initial release.
